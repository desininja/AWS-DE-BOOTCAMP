Instruction on How to deploy:

Create a new codebuild in AWS, and upload the files into a github repo. 
From there after pushing the changes, the buildspec.yml file will copy the 
the files from github directories to S3 buckets. 
We need to create MWAA cluster and give the directories of s3 buckets of dags
requirement files into it. 
We also need to spin up EMR cluster and Redshift cluster. 
As soon as the all the required clusters are up and running, we can go to 
Airflow UI and trigger the dags from there and see our tasks getting started.
